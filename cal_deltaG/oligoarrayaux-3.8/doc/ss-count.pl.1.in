.SH NAME
ss-count.pl \- compute ss-count from a .ct file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ss-count.pl
.RI [ OPTION ]...
.I file.ct
.RI [ file.ext ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBss-count.pl\fR computes the ss-count of each base for a set of structures in \fI.ct\fR format.  The ss-count is the number of structures in which the base appears single-stranded.
.P
The output from \fBss-count.pl\fR is suitable for structure annotation with \fBsir_graph\fR.
.P
If a \fI.ext\fR file is given, it is assumed to contain the correct probabilities.  The output is expanded to include for each base the expected probability of being single-stranded, the standard deviation, the observed probability and the relative error (the observed probability minus the expected probability, divided by the standard deviation).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -n ", " --normalized
divides the ss-count for each base by the number of structures, to obtain a value in the range [0, 1].  Normalization is automatic when a \fI.ext\fR file is supplied.
.TP
.BR -w ", " --weighted
computes a weighted sum or average, where the weights are the Boltzmann factors for each structure.  Each Boltzmann factor is computed from a header line in the \fI.ct\fR file.
.TP
.BR -t ", " --temperature =\fItemp
sets the temperature for Boltzmann-weighting to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 37.
