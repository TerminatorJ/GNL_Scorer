.SH NAME
hybrid-min \- hybridize two RNA or DNA sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hybrid-min
.RI [ OPTION ]...
.I FILE1 FILE2
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhybrid-min\fR computes a minimum energy hybridization of the sequences in \fIFILE1\fR and \fIFILE2\fR.  If the suffix option is used, the hybridization is computed using the energy rules with the \fIsuffix\fR extension; otherwise, it is computed at each temperature from tMin to tMax degrees Celsius, in increments of tInc degrees.  All output files are named with a \fIprefix\fR which consists of the first file name, a dash and the second file name, with the extension .seq removed from each file name.  The free energy at each temperature is written to \fIprefix.dG\fR.  The minimum energy structure is written to \fIprefix.temperature.ct\fR, and an ASCII representation is written to \fIprefix.temperature.asc\fR.  \fBhybrid-min\fR also writes \fIprefix.temperature.plot\fR and \fIprefix.temperature.ext\fR in the manner of \fBhybrid\fR; each probability is either 1 or 0.  A summary of the options the program was invoked with is written to \fIprefix.run\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -n ", " --NA =RNA|DNA
sets nucleic acid type to RNA or DNA.  Default is RNA.
.TP
.BR -t ", " --tmin =\fItemp
sets minimum temperature to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 37.
.TP
.BR -i ", " --tinc =\fItemp
sets temperature increment to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 1.
.TP
.BR -T ", " --tmax =\fItemp
sets maximum temperature to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 37.
.TP
.BR -N ", " --sodium =\fIvalue
sets Sodium ion concentration to \fIvalue\fR molar.  Default is 1.
.TP
.BR -M ", " --magnesium =\fIvalue
sets Magnesium ion concentration to \fIvalue\fR molar.  Default is 0.
.TP
.BR -p ", " --polymer
use salt corrections for polymers instead of oligomers (the default).
.TP
.BR -s ", " --suffix =\fIstring
use energy rules with the suffix \fIstring\fR.  Overrides \fB--tmin\fR, \fB--tinc\fR, \fB--tmax\fR, \fB--sodium\fR, \fB--magnesium\fR and \fB--polymer\fR.
.TP
.BR -o ", " --output =\fIprefix
name output files with \fIprefix\fR.
.TP
.BR -r ", " --prohibit =\fIi\fR,\fIj\fR[,\fIk\fR]
prohibit all basepairs in the helix from \fIi\fR,\fIj\fR to \fIi+k-1\fR,\fIj-k+1\fR.  If \fIj\fR is 0, prohibit bases \fIi\fR to \fIi+k-1\fR of the first sequence from pairing at all; if \fIi\fR is 0, prohibit bases \fIj\fR to \fIj-k+1\fR of the second sequence from pairing at all.  \fIk\fR defaults to 1 if not specified.
.TP
.BR -f ", " --force =\fIi\fR,\fIj\fR[,\fIk\fR]
force all basepairs in the helix from \fIi\fR,\fIj\fR to \fIi+k-1\fR,\fIj-k+1\fR.  If \fIj\fR is 0, forces bases \fIi\fR to \fIi+k-1\fR of the first sequence to be double-stranded; if \fIi\fR is 0, forces bases \fIj\fR to \fIj-k+1\fR of the second sequence to be double-stranded.  \fIk\fR defaults to 1 if not specified.
.TP
.BR -E ", " --energyOnly
skips computation of structure and outputs only \fIprefix.dG\fR and \fIprefix.run\fR.  This mode uses less time and memory.
.TP
.BR -I ", " --noisolate
prohibits all isolated basepairs.  Isolated basepairs are helices of length 1; that is, they do not stack on another basepair on either side.  (See also the \fB--prefilter\fR option below.)
.TP
.BR -z ", " --zip
enforces "zipping up" helices by forcing single-stranded bases to dangle on adjacent basepairs when possible.
.TP
.BR -F ", " --mfold =\fIP\fR,\fIW\fR,\fIMAX
causes \fBhybrid-min\fR to perform multiple (suboptimal) tracebacks in the style of mfold.  \fIP\fR indicates the percent suboptimality to consider; only structures with energies within \fIP\fR% of the minimum will be output.  \fIW\fR indicates the window size; a structure must have at least \fIW\fR basepairs that are each a distance of at least \fIW\fR away from any basepair in a previous structure.  \fIMAX\fR represents an absolute limit on the number of structures computed.  When \fB--mfold\fR is specified, \fBhybrid-min\fR also writes \fIprefix.ann\fR and \fIprefix.plot\fR.  These files contain the p-num values and the energy dot plot, respectively.
.TP
.BR -q ", " --quiet
In quiet mode \fBhybrid-min\fR interprets the two arguments on the command line as sequences themselves, rather than as names of files containing sequences.  In addition, no files are written and standard output consists only of the free energy.
.TP
.BR -c ", " --constraints =\fIfile
reads a list of constraints from \fIfile\fR.  Constraints must be in the form "P \fIi\fR \fIj\fR \fIk\fR" or "F \fIi\fR \fIj\fR \fIk\fR".  These are equivalent to specifying "--prohibit=\fIi\fR,\fIj\fR,\fIk\fR" and "--force=\fIi\fR,\fIj\fR,\fIk\fR", respectively.  If \fIfile\fR is not specified, it defaults to \fIprefix.aux\fR.
.TP
.BR -b ", " --basepairs =\fIfile
reads a list of allowable helices from \fIfile\fR.  Each helix consists of three whitespace-delimited numbers which specify the starting basepair and the length of the helix.  When this option is used, all basepairs except those in \fIfile\fR are prohibited from forming.
.SH OBSCURE OPTIONS
.TP
.B --allpairs
allows basepairs to form between any two nucleotides.  When \fB--allpairs\fR is not specified, only Watson-Crick and wobble basepairs are allowed.
.TP
.BR --maxloop =\fIsize
sets the maximum size of bulge/interior loops to \fIsize\fR.  Default is 30.
.TP
.B --nodangle
removes single-base stacking from consideration.
.TP
.BR --prefilter =\fIvalue1\fR[,\fIvalue2\fR]
Sets the prefilter to filter out all basepairs except those in groups of \fIvalue2\fR adjacent basepairs of which \fIvalue1\fR can form.  \fIvalue2\fR is the same as \fIvalue1\fR if unspecified.  Default is 2 of 2.  (See also the \fB--noisolate\fR option above.)
.TP
.B --stream
reads sequences from standard input rather than files.  Quiet mode is implied, so that free energies are written on standard output and no files are created.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP UNAFOLDDAT
an alternate location from which to read the energy rules.  The default energy rules can be overridden with files in the current directory or in the directory pointed to by UNAFOLDDAT.  \fBhybrid-min\fR looks for each file first in the current directory, then in the directory specified by UNAFOLDDAT and last in \fI/usr/local/share/unafold\fR (or wherever the energy rules were installed).
